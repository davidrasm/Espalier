Welcome to Espalier's documentation!
====================================

Espalier is a Python package for working with discordant phylogenetic trees using maximum agreement forests. The package can be used to compute maximum agreement forests, compute subtree-prune-and-regraft (SPR) distances, reconcile discordant trees and reconstruct ancestral recombination graphs (ARGs).
